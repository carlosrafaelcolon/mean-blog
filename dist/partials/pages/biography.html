In my teens, I attended a vocational-technical high school and was part of the Automotive Collision Repair program. Admittedly, my decision to become an auto body repair technician was largely influenced by MTV's hit show "Pimp My Ride". It was sometime around my sophomore year that I started to read the works of Darren Shan, James Patterson and Chris Crutcher and developed an interest in writing. Shortly thereafter, I spent most of my time at the school library, making false starts on several novels, which I never completed, and avoiding my shop instructors (to do more reading). Surprisingly, I not only managed to get a job working as a collision technician assistant I was also selected as the Outstanding Vocational Student in the Auto Collision Repair program for 2010.  However, as I was more interested in reading books rather than taking apart vehicles I decided to pursue a different career. So next came University.</p><p>At the University I seemed to have a Major dilemma. That is, I had a habit of switching majors ultimately extending my stay on campus. I started with Sociology, then switched to Psychology, and then added English, becoming a dual major, only to drop it the following semester to pick up Political Science. In the end, I graduated <em>Magna Cum Laude </em> from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and Psychology also earning the Commonwealth Scholar award. More importantly, during this time I co-founded the Center for the Study of Targeted Killing and co-authored the book <em>The Drone Debate: A Primer on the U.S. Use of Unmanned Aircraft Outside of Conventional Battlefields</em>. I'm still a bit baffled on how I went from trying to write a young adult fiction novel to publishing a nonfiction book on counter-terrorism operations.</p><p>Upon graduation, I entered the web industry with an interest in turning complex concepts and data on foreign policy issues into compelling visual presentations. I am completely self-taught with no formal design training, having picked things up over the years. I'm constantly pushing myself to learn new things and improve upon what I already know. Sadly, I'm still working on trying to write, complete, and then publish my first young adult novel. When not cringing over terrible drafts and bad story ideas or doing research on targeted killing operations, I'm likely working on music.</p></div><footer><p>Stay Connected</p><div class="social-box"><ul class="footer-socials"><li><a href="#" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter "></i></a></li><li><a href="#" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-instagram "></i></a></li><li><a href="#" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github-alt"></i></a></li><li><a href="#" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li></ul></div></footer></div>
