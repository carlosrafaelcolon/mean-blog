						body : "<p><em>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://thejerusalemreview.com/2012/11/05/ayoub-and-the-drone-revolution/\" target=\"_blank\">The Jerusalem Review of Near East Affairs</a></em></p><p>The recent breach of Israeli airspace by a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone has prompted a debate about the proliferation of drone technology and the unprecedented technological capabilities, deterrent power, and war provocation this entails. On October 6, 2012, the unmanned aircraft flew “tens of kilometers” over sensitive areas like gas and oil facilities undetected until being shot down near the Dimona nuclear reactor. Hezbollah not only claimed responsibility for this provocative flight, but said that it was their natural right, naming the reconnaissance drone Ayoub, in honor of a deceased Hezbollah party member who helped pioneer their drone technology. Following this incident, Lebanese politicians accused their government of being an Iranian proxy, Israeli policymakers questioned their national security, and Iran threatened Israel with a fleet of (they claim) hundreds of other drones in twenty-five different models. The incident itself, however, is not the first of its kind.</p><p>In 2010, an Israeli warplane shot down an unmanned balloon that flew over the Dimona nuclear reactor, while numerous drones were shot down during the 2006 war with Hezbollah. With Syria’s civil war, Iran’s controversial nuclear program, and Israel’s consideration of preemptive action, the Ayoub operation clearly threatens the delicate balance of interstate peace in the region. But, it is also important to momentarily step back and try to look at the broader implications of the operation. The Ayoub incident, for better or worse, is part of a greater movement which has been described as the “drone revolution.” Among both advocates and critics of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), none can deny the ongoing effect this technology is having on modern warfare and espionage. Brian Glyn Williams of the University of Massachusetts presented facts that make this <a href=\"http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=39171&cHash=9ee7a849eb700b78b9fd0825085d037e\" target=\"_blank\">phenomenon</a> clear:</p><blockquote><p>“More than 50 countries have built or bought drones….Over the next decade more than $94 billion is expected to be spent globally on drone research and procurement. In 2000, the United States had just 50 drones. Today almost one in three U.S. warplanes is a drone. That translates to approximately 7,500 drones in the U.S. fleet. Since 2005, there has been a 1200% increase in patrols by drones. The U.S. Air Force trained more drone pilots in 2011 than pilots for fighter and bomber aircraft combined.”</p></blockquote><p>When discussing drones, we must consider not only the strategic gains and losses, but the long term consequences of this “revolution.” What does drone proliferation entail for the future — both in the near- and long-term? Looking at the covert campaigns in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, the apparent shift to targeting individuals based on their <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/02/27/the_obama_doctrine?page=0,2\" target=\"_blank\">behavior</a> (called “signature strikes”) is extremely foreboding. The precedent being set by the United States may be used as a justification by other states to execute similar attacks once their technology matures. These operations also tend to rely on local sources for intelligence, and in some parts these “local partners” may actually be providing inaccurate intelligence to satisfy their own objectives. These methods in life and death decisions lead to executions by drones without direct confirmation of whom the targets actually are. Congressman Dennis Kucinich, in an <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/06/29/a-journey-into-moral-depravity-us-congressman-dennis-kucinich-on-covert-wars/\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, said that the drone program “bespeaks an approach which depraves moral law, the constitution, and international law. That sets us into an endless cycle of violence.” If the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all\" target=\"_blank\">Obama administration</a> currently “counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants…unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent”, can we assume other nations will follow higher standards?</p><p>Responsibility for the standard operating procedure for drones will not be the only issue, but also determining who should be held accountable for unjust actions. Before it was Ayoub, it was a mystery drone with reports calling it “foreign.” One of the benefits of unmanned machines is that it provides some culpable deniability to its user. Today, of course, this isn’t much of an issue, but we can’t presume that America will hold such a near-monopoly on unmanned systems forever. Policymakers have to ask themselves what precedents the United States is setting. How will access to drones affect the Middle East’s regional security — or other regions, for that matter? We may not be able to predict the future, but given what has happened so far, avoiding proper policy discussions that can enable greater transparency and accountability is just as dire for the years ahead.</p>",

						body : "<p><em>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://thejerusalemreview.com/2012/11/12/the-leadership-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\">The Jerusalem Review of Near East Affairs</a></em></p><p>By and large, the recent Syrian ceasefire existed in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20085993\" target=\"_blank\">name</a> only, with low expectations for success from the onset. The recent opinion piece \“<a href=\"https://thejerusalemreview.com/2012/10/31/too-little-too-late/ \" target=\"_blank\">Too Little, Too Late</a>,\” written by Jerusalem Review Staff Writer Dan Yonker outlined many valid points as to why latest failure beckons a military intervention either through humanitarian assistance or invoking NATO’s Article V.  However, Yonkers overlooks a crucial factor in his argument — the composition of Syria’s opposition, made up largely of various factions and foreign fighters. In response, it is first important to point out that Syria is not Libya. Any intervention would have to take into account the roles Russia, China, and Iran would play. In addition to this, Syria’s chemical weapons stockpile could upset analysts’ calculations. These factors provide a stronger incentive for leadership coalition. According to a United Nations investigator, the growing presence of Islamic fundamentalist fighters is among the \“<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/17/world/meast/syria-civil-war/index.html?iref=allsearch\" target=\"_blank\">most alarming</a>\" trends in Syria’s civil war, and a advocating a military intervention that does not address this pressing concern is dangerously flawed.  Moreover, a military intervention conducted amid such a fragmented opposition, plagued with infighting and forms of radicalism, opens the door to sectarian warfare, reprisal killings, and a rise in extremism in post-Assad Syria. Furthermore, the new video showing anti-government fighters <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/world/middleeast/un-says-syria-execution-video-shows-apparent-war-crime.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">kicking and summarily executing</a> a group of frightened loyalist soldiers not only <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/03/syria-military-council-aleppo-rebels\" target=\"_blank\">widens the split</a> among rebel groups but raises the question: who will lead Syria in the post-Assad era?</p><p>Highlighting the importance of having a \“<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-looks-to-build-alternative-syrian-opposition-leadership/2012/10/31/ccfc7a40-2388-11e2-8448-81b1ce7d6978_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">visible leader</a>\”, the United States has already <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2012/1101/Behind-the-US-gambit-to-seek-new-anti-Assad-leadership-in-Syria\" target=\"_blank\">pulled its support</a> from the opposition Syrian National Council to search for an alternative. Simply put, a greater degree of leadership is required before any military intervention is decided. Additionally, while media and public debates tend to focus on the downfall of Assad, serious discussion questioning the legitimacy of the opposition is largely absent. To be clear, I do not support the actions of the Assad regime, but it is important to look at the situation in its entirety. As the conflict further plunges into the <a href=\"https://thejerusalemreview.com/2012/10/23/the-worst-case-scenario/\" target=\"_blank\">worst-case scenario</a>, simply asking for an objective approach has become a tall task. Blood has been spilled, lives have been lost, judgments have been clouded by emotion, and war crimes have been committed (on both sides). And, quite frankly, the mainstream media, the activists, the fighters on each side, and the common citizens have already picked sides.</p><p>The United Nations has accused the Syrian army and the shabiha for the atrocities behind the Houla massacre, but without any conclusive evidence isn’t it possible that the massacre was a false-flag operation? The Syrian rebels have been supported by various countries, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, with Barack Obama allegedly signing a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/01/us-usa-syria-obama-order-idUSBRE8701OK20120801\" target=\"_blank\">secret order authorizing</a> U.S. support for rebels seeking to oust Assad earlier this year. But isn’t it possible that these actions are supporting, arming, and financing al Qaeda <a href=\"http://www.presstv.com/detail/2012/06/23/247562/nato-financing-alqaeda-gangs-in-syria/\" target=\"_blank\">death squads</a>? The escalating conflict between Damascus and Ankara is now being used to frame an argument where the attacks provide a legal justification for NATO intervention. But how justified is it?</p><p>Turkey did lose a fighter plane to Syrian air defenses in June 2012, but didn’t the Turkish warplane, a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/23/world/middleeast/mass-killing-reported-in-syria-apparently-a-rebel-ambush.html\" target=\"_blank\">F-4 Phantom jet</a> to be exact, violate Syrian airspace? The recent Syrian <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/03/world/europe/turkey-syria-tension/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">artillery strike</a> that killed Turkish citizens worsened the situation and, as a consequence, made NATO an even more likely actor in the Syrian civil war. However, with Turkey admittedly harboring units of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/world/europe/turkey-is-sheltering-antigovernment-syrian-militia.html?pagewanted=2\" target=\"_blank\">Free Syrian Army</a> and allowing them to orchestrate attacks across the border, why wouldn’t Turkey be a legitimate target for the Assad regime?</p><p>Given the current state of the fractured opposition and the level of ambiguity in Syria actions regarding Turkey as well as domestically, threatening to invoke Article V as self-defense is not a wise-decision. It has to be understood that Article V has only been invoked once in NATO’s history, after the attack on September 11, 2001. The issues between Syria and Turkey don’t compare, in terms of a legal justification, to that of 9/11. Intervening militarily without an established opposition leader will leave the peace process for a post-Assad Syria in shambles. In How Wars End, Gideon Rose observes that \‘‘[t]ime and again throughout history, political and military leaders have ignored the need for careful postwar planning or approached the task with visions of sugarplums dancing in their heads.\’’ It is hard to stomach, and even more difficult to accept, but we always have to focus on what comes after. Just recently, Syria’s fragmented groups have already begun negotiations (once again) to forge a unified opposition, in Doha, Qatar.</p><p>Let’s hope for the best.</p>",

						pubDate : "January 2, 2013",
						body : "<p><em>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://thejerusalemreview.com/2013/01/02/in-syria-a-rise-of-jihadists/\" target=\"_blank\">The Jerusalem Review of Near East Affairs</a></em></p><p>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is fighting against time as the rebel forces continue to gain ground. Russia, Syria’s largest arms supplier and a block to international efforts to intervene, has indicated that the opposition might win and more recently, President Vladimir Putin emphasized that they are not defenders of \“<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/world/europe/putin-in-brussels-for-talks-with-european-union.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">the current Syrian leadership.</a>\” As Russia distances itself from Assad’s government, the regime’s 42-year relationship with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) appears to be eroding as well. PLO officials claimed that the regime’s attack on the Yarmouk refugee camp, which killed as many as 25 people, marks a \"historical moment\" with thousands of Palestinians now fleeing Damascus. While Assad is becoming further isolated, support for rebel forces continues to grow.</p><p>Though it is not new to the Syrian Civil War, the growing number of Islamic fundamentalist fighters remains a serious concern, and one that I have raised before. Although the opposition is closer to victory and has been formally recognized by countries such as Britain, France and much of the Arab League, the threat posed by the growing appeal of jihadi ideology has been growing at an even faster pace. In a Middle East security report, Elizabeth O’Bagy said that \“[i]n Libya, Egypt and Tunisia, jihadist elements and extremists did not have major networks on the ground where they could exploit their own authority and influence in those revolutions. In Syria, however, they do have those networks.\” This is due to the Syrian government’s history of sponsoring terrorism which contributed to the jihadist foothold in the country.</p><p>The actions taken by the international community have been empowering al Qaeda-linked extremists rather than deterring them. They are becoming both powerful and popular. When the United States declared al-Nusra Front a \“foreign terrorist organization,\” the Syrian National Coalition opposed the decision, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamad Tayfur condemned it, and many non-Islamist members of the coalition also objected to the label. Moreover, a recent video footage showed crowds in southern Syria denouncing the U.S. designation, highlighting its wide support throughout the country. With the growing influence of Islamic fundamentalist fighters, a Die Welt investigation asked, \“Has Syria become al Qaeda’s new base for terror strikes on Europe?\” The report discussed how the terror network in Syria includes dozens of European members and according to the Long War Journal, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is focusing his efforts on Syria, allegedly through al-Nusra Front’s leader, Abu Muhammad al-Julani. Latest reports, discusses the emergence of a new jihadist group in Syria called Jund al Sham (Army of the Levant). According to LWJ, \“Jihadist groups are popping up left and right in Syria as President Bashir al Assad’s regime continues to crumble.\”</p><p>I’ve stressed the importance of having an established opposition leader before, but the fact that the opposition continues to ally with foreign jihadists makes things problematic. Any military backing from the West will indirectly support al Qaeda affiliated groups. Others emphasized that they are still an extremely small part of the groups that are fighting the Syrian regime. However, the real power behind radical extremists resides in their ability to influence others, as the number of people persuaded by their ideology continue to increase. Additionally, the Syrian conflict is a magnet for terror networks, and as the conflict drags on their numbers are likely to continue growing.</p><p>The answer is not through an intervention, but rather a negotiated settlement with regional and international backing. But needless to say, a resolution through diplomatic means will be difficult to achieve. It is unclear if there is even a concerted effort to truly end the crisis through negotiations.Two days after the bombing of the Palestinian refugee camp, a U.N. General Assembly meeting took place. Nine Mideast-related resolutions criticizing Israel were passed by large majorities, while the only reference to Syria was to the \“occupied Syrian Golan.\” Previously, on November 30, the assembly set aside one hour to discuss the Syrian conflict and then not a single delegate took the floor except for Syria’s. Bashar Ja’afari, the Syrian ambassador who spoke for 22 minutes, had a three-minute time limit, but no one interrupted him after Ja’afari exceeded his limit, and no one spoke afterwards. No matter what your stance may be on the Syrian crisis, the fact that the Syrian delegate was the only one to speak at the session reveals the shortcomings of current diplomacy. When the military might of Syria’s friends overwhelms their diplomatic assets, it becomes far too simple to overlook the strengths of negotiation for our faith in firepower. One thing is certain, though. The Syrian conflict will continue long after the fall of the Assad regime.</p>",

						body : "<p><em>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://thejerusalemreview.com/2013/01/30/irans-naval-strategy-planning-for-the-worst/\" target=\"_blank\">The Jerusalem Review of Near East Affairs</a></em></p><p>\“<a href=\"http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/01/13/283345/irgc-navy-stages-tactical-training-drill/\" target=\"_blank\">Our present capabilities are incomparable to the past</a>,\” said the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Navy commander, Rear-Admiral Reza Torabi, during the recent naval drill exercises aimed at honing battle tactics in the strategic Strait of Hormuz. The war games continue as tensions rise, with naval forces taking center stage. In light of the increasing IRGC naval activities in the maritime environment, now is the time to discuss Iran’s naval strategy and how America can best prepare to counter it.</p><p>Guerre de course, as detailed in Robert Worley’s book titled Shaping U.S. Military Forces, favors distributed operations and avoids decisive fleet engagement, preferring to attack through commerce warfare. This is worth mentioning because ever since the end of the Iran-Iraq War, Iran has been strengthening a guerre de course strategy built on sophisticated mines, midget submarines, mobile anti-ship cruise missiles, a fleet of small, fast boats and the ability to conceal and deploy its artillery amid the numerous coves, inlets, and islands.  Furthermore, according to a 2008 report by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the IRGC Navy’s inability to properly retaliate through conventional means against Iraqi led to a shift in strategic thinking. Lacking the proper means to respond the IRGC Navy were then tasked to develop and implement naval unconventional guerrilla warfare tactics using speedboats. By the end of the war, one of the identified requirements for IRGC Navy was \“the importance of initiative and the avoidance of frontal engagements with large U.S. naval surface warfare elements,\” an important aspect of guerre de course.</p><p>Put into effect, this approach includes commerce raiding which employs hit and run tactics to destroy or capture resources at sea or ashore. For Iran, the aim would be to exploit enemy vulnerabilities through the use of \“swarming\” tactics by well-armed small boats and fast-attack craft. When discussing the Iranian sea power  it is also important to point out, as an article published in November noted, \“[t]he Iranians do not have to win outright at sea to achieve geopolitical goals; economic disruption of the West may be enough.\” Firstly, there is no need for Iran to withstand the full power of U.S. Navy and its allies when they can simply avoid it. Secondly, the Iranian asymmetric threat will likely be achieving strategic objectives through prolonged campaigns against commerce that erode the enemies’ ability and will to wage war. As Robert Worley explained, guerre de course seeks to cripple the enemy through commerce warfare which will be done by attacking the enemy’s weakest point rather than its strongest.</p><p>Besides sea power, there are many factors influencing why Iran will adopt a strategy that uses tactics unacceptable to its opponent. Given the United States and its allies dependence on Strait of Hormuz, guerre de course becomes an attractive strategy because of the many high value targets scattered around the region (the onshore and offshore production facilities). Moreover, the coastal geography along with the bases, staging areas, and routes increases Iran’s capability to execute \“surprise attacks at unexpected times and places\” a key component to their asymmetric naval operations. The sea condition of the area also plays a factor. The coastal waters are shallow and irregular with complex currents that affect large ships and can interfere with the electromagnetic spectrum that a technologically superior force like the United States favors.</p><p>A strategy is what dictates how the military will invest limited funds in preparation for combat. By adopting a guerre de course strategy, Iran can afford to buy low cost vessels in large quantities. This seems to indicate that Iran will not be investing in expensive capital-ship programs and will remain in littoral waters rather than attacking at sea where the element of surprise is gone and technological superiority awaits them. Any potential method of attack will be through distributed operations using low-cost armed speedboats in large numbers (including other vessels that are cheap to build and operate). In response, a counter strategy for the U.S. does not have to worry about an outright defeat but being denied access for too long. Their task is to achieve its objective without squandering too much resource. The problem at hand, however, is that the U.S. military appears to be investing in expensive fleets to fight at sea rather than preparing for combat in littoral waters where a naval battle with Iran would take place. The American strategy may be to create a deterrent — but if war with Iran does indeed break out, the U.S. Navy may be unready for precisely the type of water war Iran plans to wage.</p>",
